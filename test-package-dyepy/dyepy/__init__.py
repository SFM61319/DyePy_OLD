"""A Python module to work with anything related to colors.

From styling the text to changing the foreground and background colors
to converting colors to and from different color spaces, or defaulting
them to Hexadecimal codes/values (as most Python modules support or
only accept HEX codes), this module can easily help you with ALL of it. And
yeah, it even has CSS3 color support (like named colors with their
respective Hex values and some added colors - which are famous or are
used/seen a lot).

Detailed description/documentation for each and every class and
function is written to make everything in the module understandable to
every python developer. It is recommended to run this module - or a
program this module is being imported in - to be ran on a command-line
(like Bash, PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) for the module to work
properly and give the most accurate and complete results (although
results may vary with the command-lines, and some font styles may not
work if they are not supported by the command-line)
